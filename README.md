<h1>Welcome to Spaceman!</h1>
<h3>In this game we will get to guess the names of Betsy's friends. BUT, if you run out of guesses before you reach a correct answer, you'll have to embark on a trip to Mars. Roger that, Major Tom!</h3>
<h4>To run this program, clone into this repository and pull up the Spaceman folder in your terminal. Once there run the code "python3 main.py" and have fun!<h4>
